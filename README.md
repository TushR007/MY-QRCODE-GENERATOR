# MY-QRCODE-GENERATOR

This project created by me was because of my curiosity of QR-Codes

It is a simple static website created using HTML,Tailwind CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

You can generate a QR-code by entering the URL of varying sizes from 10OX100 to 700X700.

A QR-Code is generated with the help of a Cross-browser QRCode generator for javascript:

It is deployed on netlify and you can access it here using the link below :

These are some screenshots of the website:
